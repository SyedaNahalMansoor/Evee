                            of the booking; any request for color change after issuance of this PBO shall

                                its factory shall be final and conclusive for all purposes. All risk of damage
                                or defect, other than that covered under the standard warranty by evee Electric
                                (the "Ownership Risks"), as well as the title of the Vehicle, shall
                                stand transferred to the Applicant on the date the Vehicle is dispatched from
                                evee Electric's premises under a third-party insurance and transportation
                                arranged, and fully paid for on behalf of the Applicant, by evee Electric.
                                However, in case of an open stock transfer to evee Electric, the Ownership
                                Risks and title of the Vehicle shall stand transferred to the Applicant on the
                                date of delivery to the Applicant. No third-party inspection of the vehicle on

                                    taken back by evee Electric for any reason whatsoever. In the event that an
                                    Applicant has been informed about the delivery date and is unable or unwilling
                                    to take the delivery of the Vehicle after dispatch of the Vehicle from the
                                    factory evee Electric will hold custody of the vehicle on behalf of the
                                    Applicant for up to fifteen (15) days or any further time period allowed by the

                                    to the Vehicle during the Holding Period shall be on the account of the
                                    Applicant. Failure of the Applicant to take delivery during the Holding Period
                                    shall entitle evee Electric to deal with the Vehicle in any manner deemed fit
                                    at its sole discretion.</p>

                                        Applicant. Any delay in making outstanding payment will lead to Applicant
                                        default for which evee Electric may charge service charges.</p>

                                            amount within the due Payment Period, the Applicant acknowledges that evee
                                            Electric will consider the order "Defaulted". In case of default,
                                            Applicant agrees to waive his right of any penalty payment on account of delay
